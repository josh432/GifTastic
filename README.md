# GifTastic

Giftastic makes AJAX calls to fetch GIF's from GIPHY API and displays them on the page. Built using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and Javascript. I used a children's theme for this project and added ragtime music because it reminded me of silent movies (and GIFS). I loved seeing the final project deployed here: https://josh432.github.io/GifTastic/index.html
